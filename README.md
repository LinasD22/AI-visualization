# AI Visualizations with RAG

**AI Visualizations with RAG** is an AI-powered web application built with Streamlit that leverages Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques to automatically analyze CSV datasets, generate insightful visualizations, and provide AI-driven data insights. The application integrates Google Gemini for generative content and interactive AI chat functionality.

## Overview

- **Automatic Data Processing:** Upload CSV files to view data previews, numerical summaries, and categorical insights.
- **Dynamic Visualizations:** Generate histograms, bar charts, line charts, scatter plots, and more based on your data types.
- **AI-Driven Analysis:** Use RAG techniques to select important features, explain correlations, and get concise AI-generated insights.
- **Interactive Chat:** Engage with an AI agent to ask questions and receive detailed explanations about your dataset.

## Prerequisites
